# Notes

## Game ideas

- People should be first class citizens of the game mechanics
  - Can move around the board
  - Would make initial stages more CIV like
  - Should make the game much more tactical eg certain people have skills which are better against some zombies (assumes different zombie types)
  - Should do this at a later point
  - People can have the following bonuses:
    - fighting certain Zombies
    - covering certain tiles eg production bonus
    - exploring
- People can level up
- People can equip stuff

## Tech stuff

- Try to optimise render cycle
- Redux should represent the state, rendering the board is a side effect
- At some point, add animations
- Need to tackle zooming around the board
  - Need some clever stuff like Infinitown?
