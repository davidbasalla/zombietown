# 0001 - Try out Redux Selectors

Based on https://redux.js.org/introduction/learning-resources#selectors and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frT3to2ACCw.

State like `foodGrowth` can be seen as derived data. Move the logic to a selector.

Interesting in that it forces thinking of how to determine types of state. State can be derived state or actual state.
