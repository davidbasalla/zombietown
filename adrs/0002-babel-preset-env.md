# 0002 - Try out Babel Preset Env

Apparently using Babel Preset Env to transpile JS code is standard best practice these days. It solves the problem of the transpiler converting code that's already supported by modern browser versions. See http://2ality.com/2017/02/babel-preset-env.html for a succint explanation.
